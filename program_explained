main -> getPaste (return str[] lines of input)
  getPaste asks the user for the number of lines in their input, then requires that many lines of input
  
main -> getBreak (return int break time minutes) - loop 3
  getBreak extracts the break time in minutes from the line, which should contain "Break" | "Lunch"
  
main -> openBrowserWindows
  oBW takes in the iterator for the hash map which should contain the 3 breaks
   from that iterator, oBW will extract the name of the break ("Break" | "Lunch")
   then call browserTimer with the name and time
   
   openBrowserWindows -> browserTimer
    browserTimer sends the command into command prompt "start chrome" + site,
   where site is the url to be searched using the default web browser (opens the browser window at the given address, i.e. site)
