program sequence:

main ->
. creates holder for schedule
. creates holder for the user input, size determined by user input as well
. creates temporary holders for each part of the schedule (namely: 3 breaks, including lunch) // there is one unused variable: day
. notes the current year and day
. creates a holder for yearGood, meaning if the correct year is found // this is for days like new year's, if you work overnight it goes 2018->2019

. the loop begins, and each time checks if the line contains the year. If not, it will check if yearGood is true (if this is the correct year)

-- INCORRECT: program needs to check if the DAY is good along with the year // yes, just in case the user inputs the wrong schedule

corrected, solved the issue of the day not actually being checked

Time stamps are in the actual commit
Wondering what else I can do to this program
I want to port it to mobile eventually
* Implement LocalDate somewhere, remove some clutter
allow the timers to be updated if break has been taken late
  GUI -> [Late Break / Lunch] -> ("Time taken?" +timeInputBox | [Now])

The program should be finished and workng by now, just need to test it with eclipse ide and then implement future plans
